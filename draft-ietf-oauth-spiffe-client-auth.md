--- abstract

This specification profiles the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants {{RFC7521}}, the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants {{RFC7523}}, and OAuth 2.0 Attestation-Based Client Authentication {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}} to enable the use of SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVIDs) as client credentials in OAuth 2.0. It defines how OAuth clients with SPIFFE credentials can authenticate to OAuth authorization servers using their JWT-SVIDs, WIT-SVIDs, or X509-SVIDs without the need for client secrets. This approach enhances security by enabling seamless integration between SPIFFE-enabled workloads and OAuth authorization servers while eliminating the need to distribute and manage shared secrets such as static client secrets.

# Introduction

Traditional OAuth client authentication typically relies on client secrets or private key JWT authentication, both require an out of band distribution of secret material to the OAuth client. In modern cloud-native architectures where identity is managed by SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone), there is a need to provision additional secret material for OAuth clients when attested identifiers and credentials such as SVIDs are already available.

This specification profiles the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants {{RFC7521}} to allow SPIFFE-enabled workloads to use their SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Documents (SVIDs), either X.509 certificates or JSON Web Tokens (JWT-SVID & WIT-SVID), as client credentials for OAuth 2.0 client authentication. JWT-SVIDs make use of a profiled version of the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication and Authorization Grants {{RFC7523}}. WIT-SVIDs make use of the OAuth 2.0 Attestation-Based Client Authentication {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}}.

This profile focuses on using SPIFFE credentials for OAuth client authentication.

The SPIFFE profile for client authentication enables seamless integration between SPIFFE-based and OAuth-based systems, allowing applications to leverage both ecosystems without requiring additional credential management. It also enables a more secure authentication method by leveraging cryptographically verifiable credentials rather than shared secrets.

# Conventions and Definitions

## Terminology

This specification uses the terms defined in OAuth 2.0 {{RFC6749}}, the Assertion Framework for OAuth 2.0 {{RFC7521}}, the JWT profile of it {{RFC7523}}, and the SPIFFE specifications. The following terms are used in this document:

**Trust Domain**: As defined in SPIFFE; A trust domain represents a single trust root. All SVIDs issued within a trust domain are verifiable via the trust domain's keys.

**SPIFFE ID**: A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that uniquely identifies a workload using the `spiffe` scheme. See {{SPIFFE_ID}} for details.

**SVID**: A SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document. This document specifies the use of three types of SVIDs:

- **X509-SVID**: An X.509 certificate that contains a SPIFFE ID in the URI SAN extension. See {{SPIFFE_X509}} for details.

- **JWT-SVID**: A JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains a SPIFFE ID in the `sub` claim. See {{SPIFFE_JWT}} for details.

- **WIT-SVID**: A WIMSE Workload Identity Token (WIT) that contains a SPIFFE ID in the `sub` claim. See {{SPIFFE_WIT}} for details.

**SPIFFE Bundle**: A collection of public keys and associated metadata that allow validation of SVIDs issued by a trust domain.

**SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint**: A URL that serves a SPIFFE bundle for a trust domain.

# OAuth Client Authentication Using SPIFFE

This section describes how SPIFFE identity documents can be used for OAuth 2.0 client authentication, following the patterns established in {{RFC7521}} and, for JWT-SVIDs, {{RFC7523}}.


OAuth 2.0 client authentication is used to authenticate the client to the authorization server when making requests to the token endpoint. When using SPIFFE for client authentication, the client presents its SVID (JWT-SVID, WIT-SVID, or X509-SVID) to prove its identity.

## Client Identification {#client-identification}

The `client_id` request parameter is OPTIONAL for all client authentication methods defined in this specification.

If the request contains a `client_id` parameter, the authorization server MUST verify that the SPIFFE ID of the presented SVID is authorized to authenticate as the client identified by the `client_id`:

* If the `client_id` is a URL pointing to a Client ID Metadata Document ({{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}), the SPIFFE ID MUST match the `spiffe_id` value in that document as described in {{client-registration-metadata}}.
* Otherwise, the SPIFFE ID MUST be associated with the `client_id` through the client's registration with the authorization server.

If the request does not contain a `client_id` parameter, the SPIFFE ID of the presented SVID is the client identifier. The authorization server MUST identify the client as the registered client whose `client_id` is equal to that SPIFFE ID. Clients identified by a Client ID Metadata Document MUST include the `client_id` parameter.

In all other cases, the authorization server MUST reject the request with an `invalid_client` error as defined in Section 5.2 of {{RFC6749}}.

A client SHOULD include the `client_id` parameter whenever its client identifier differs from its SPIFFE ID.

## Client Authentication with JWT-SVIDs {#jwt-svid}

JWT-SVID based authentication follows the JWT Profile for OAuth 2.0 Client Authentication {{RFC7523}}, with specific adaptations for SPIFFE JWT-SVIDs. The requirements of {{RFC7521}} continue to apply.

To identify the assertion content as a JWT-SVID this specification establishes the following client assertion type as an OAuth URI according to {{RFC6755}}:

~~~
urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-spiffe
~~~

Based on {{RFC7523}} the following request parameters are used to perform client authentication in the context of this specification:

* client_id: OPTIONAL. See {{client-identification}}.
* client_assertion_type: MUST be set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-spiffe`.
* client_assertion: MUST be a single SPIFFE JWT-SVID.

To validate JWT-SVID client authentication requests the authorization server MUST:

1. Verify that the JWT is well-formed and contains all required claims (SPIFFE ID in `sub`, `aud`, and `exp`).
2. Verify that the JWT has not expired (check the `exp` claim).
3. Verify that the `aud` claim contains the issuer identifier of the authorization server as its sole value. See {{!I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-rfc7523bis}} for details.
4. Verify the JWT signature using the signing keys of the trust domains according to {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}.
5. Identify the client and verify that the SPIFFE ID in the `sub` claim is authorized to authenticate as that client according to {{client-identification}}.

### JWT-SVID example

The following example illustrates an authorization_code request to the token endpoint of an OAuth 2.0 authorization server leveraging a SPIFFE JWT-SVID to authenticate the client. The client is registered at the authorization server with `client_id` `s6BhdRkqt3` and associated with the SPIFFE ID `spiffe://example.org/my-oauth-client`.

## Client Authentication using X509-SVID {#x509-svid}

X509-SVID based authentication uses mutual TLS as defined in OAuth 2.0 Mutual-TLS Client Authentication {{RFC8705}}, with specific adaptations for SPIFFE X509-SVIDs.

To authenticate using an X509-SVID, the client establishes a mutual TLS connection with the authorization server using its X509-SVID as the client certificate. The authorization server validates the client certificate as an X509-SVID and extracts the SPIFFE ID from the URI SAN. The client MUST authenticate the authorization server using standard HTTPS server certificate verification, with the trust anchors it uses for other HTTPS connections.

The authorization server determines that X509-SVID client authentication applies from the client's registered authentication method (e.g., a `token_endpoint_auth_method` value of `spiffe_x509`), and not from the format of the `client_id` value.

The `client_id` parameter is OPTIONAL. This deviates from Section 2 of {{RFC8705}}, which requires the `client_id` parameter for mutual-TLS client authentication. Because the X509-SVID carries exactly one SPIFFE ID in its URI SAN, the client can be identified from the certificate without ambiguity. See {{client-identification}}.

The authorization server validates the client certificate according to the following rules:

1. Validate the certificate as an X509-SVID according to {{SPIFFE_X509}}.
2. Path validation MUST use only the trust anchors for the trust domain of the SPIFFE ID in the certificate's URI SAN, obtained as described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}. Other trust anchors, including those of other trust domains or the system trust store, MUST NOT be used.
3. Identify the client and verify that the SPIFFE ID in the URI SAN is authorized to authenticate as that client according to {{client-identification}}.

Authorization servers MAY issue certificate-bound access tokens as described in Section 3 of {{RFC8705}} to clients authenticated with an X509-SVID. Because X509-SVIDs are typically short-lived, such an access token cannot be used once the client's X509-SVID has been rotated, and the client needs to obtain a new access token.

### X509-SVID Example

The following request uses a refresh token to obtain a new access token. The client is `s6BhdRkqt3`, associated with the SPIFFE ID `spiffe://example.org/my-oauth-client`, and is authenticated by performing this request over a mutual TLS connection.

~~~
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token&
refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA&
client_id=s6BhdRkqt3
~~~

For clarity, the presented X509-SVID client certificate to the server decoded via `openssl x509 -text` is:

## Client Authentication with WIT-SVIDs {#wit-svid}

A WIT-SVID is a WIMSE Workload Identity Token (WIT) as defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-workload-creds}} that contains a SPIFFE ID in the `sub` claim {{SPIFFE_WIT}}. It uses OAuth 2.0 Attestation-Based Client Authentication {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}} for client authentication.

A WIT-SVID as issued by a SPIFFE implementation binds a key pair held by the client via the `cnf` claim. The key pair bound to the WIT-SVID is used to generate an attestation proof during client authentication. The attestation proof is in the form of a "Client Attestation PoP JWT" as defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}} that is issued by the client and signed with the private part of the key pair bound in the WIT-SVID.

The WIT-SVID and the corresponding Client Attestation PoP JWT are sent together to the authorization server as a means of client authentication using the HTTP header-based syntax defined in Section 5.1 of {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}}.

The `client_id` parameter is OPTIONAL. See {{client-identification}}.

### Authorization Server Validation {#wit-svid-validation}

This specification is a profile of {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}} as described in Section 13 of that document. The authorization server determines that this profile applies when the `typ` JWT header parameter of the `OAuth-Client-Attestation` header is `wit+jwt`.

To validate a WIT-SVID client authentication request, the authorization server MUST apply the following rules:

* The authorization server MUST accept `wit+jwt` as a valid value of the `typ` JWT header parameter in the `OAuth-Client-Attestation` header, in addition to `oauth-client-attestation+jwt`.
* The WIT-SVID MUST be validated as a Workload Identity Token according to Section 5.1.3 of {{I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-workload-creds}}.
* The WIT-SVID signature MUST be verified using the signing keys of the trust domain according to {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}.
* The Client Attestation PoP JWT MUST be validated according to Section 7.2 of {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}}.
* The client MUST be identified and the SPIFFE ID in the `sub` claim MUST be verified according to {{client-identification}}. This replaces the `client_id` to `sub` matching rule of {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}}.

The authorization server advertises support for WIT-SVID client authentication using the `spiffe_wit` value as described in {{interoperability}}. The `attest_jwt_client_auth` value defined in {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}} indicates support for Client Attestation JWTs in general and does not by itself indicate support for WIT-SVIDs.


### WIT-SVID Example

The following example illustrates a token request using a WIT-SVID and a Client Attestation PoP JWT for client authentication. The client is registered at the authorization server with `client_id` `s6BhdRkqt3` and associated with the SPIFFE ID `spiffe://example.org/my-oauth-client`.

# Interoperability {#interoperability}

In order to achieve interoperability between the authorization server and clients the authorization server MUST advertise what client authentication methods are supported.

Authorization servers MUST support at least one of JWT-SVID, X509-SVID or WIT-SVID. The methods supported MUST be advertised in the authorization servers metadata {{RFC8414}} by including `spiffe_jwt`, `spiffe_wit` and/or `spiffe_x509` in the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` list. Additionally, the same values should be included in `revocation_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` and `introspection_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` when applicable.

Clients MUST support at least one of JWT-SVID, X509-SVID or WIT-SVID. To guarantee interoperability a client SHOULD support all.

It is the responsibility of the client to select the authentication method supported by the authorization server and its deployment.

# SPIFFE Trust Establishment and Client Registration

This specification requires previously established trust between the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server and the SPIFFE Trust Domain. This needs to happen out of band and is not in scope of this specification. However, the mechanism of key distribution is in scope and is described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}.

Similar to the trust establishment, corresponding OAuth clients need to be registered when using SPIFFE credentials for client authentication. OAuth client registration may leverage Client ID Metadata Documents {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}, OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration {{RFC7591}} or configure them out of band.

## Client Registration Metadata {#client-registration-metadata}

This specification defines the following client metadata parameters for use in Client ID Metadata Documents {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}:

spiffe_id
: REQUIRED. The SPIFFE ID of the client, e.g. `spiffe://example.org/my-oauth-client`. The value MAY include a trailing `/*` character sequence (e.g. `spiffe://example.org/workloads/*`) indicating that a prefix match against the SPIFFE ID of the presented SVID is acceptable rather than requiring an exact match.

spiffe_bundle_endpoint
: OPTIONAL. The URL of the SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint for the client's trust domain, which the authorization server can use to retrieve the signing keys for validating the client's SVIDs. If not provided, the authorization server MUST obtain the signing keys for the client's trust domain through some other established mechanism, such as a pre-configured SPIFFE bundle. Bundles obtained from this endpoint are subject to {{client-scoped-bundles}}. See also {{cimd-bundle-security}}.

If the `spiffe_id` value uses a wildcard, it MUST end with the two-character sequence "`/*`". In this case, the authorization server MUST perform a path-segment prefix match: the SPIFFE ID of the presented SVID MUST begin with the `spiffe_id` value excluding the trailing "`*`" (i.e., up to and including the final "`/`"), and this prefix MUST correspond to complete path segment(s) of the SPIFFE ID (for example, `spiffe://example.org/client/*` matches `spiffe://example.org/client/123` but does not match `spiffe://example.org/client123`). Otherwise, the SPIFFE ID of the presented SVID MUST be an exact match of the `spiffe_id` value.

A client indicates the SPIFFE-based client authentication methods it supports in its client metadata, whether registered using Dynamic Client Registration {{RFC7591}} or published in a Client ID Metadata Document {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}, using the values defined in {{interoperability}}. A client that supports more than one method lists them in the `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` parameter defined in Section 2 of {{OpenID.RP-Metadata-Choices}}. A client SHOULD also include the `token_endpoint_auth_method` parameter {{RFC7591}} with its preferred method, so that authorization servers that do not support `token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` do not apply the {{RFC7591}} default of `client_secret_basic`.

# SPIFFE Key Distribution and Validation {#spiffe-bundle-validation}

This section describes how an authorization server verifies the signature of SVIDs. It recommends two SPIFFE-native approaches.

The 2 approaches can be used in conjunction, for instance:

~~~
Trust domain "example.org": Workload API at unix:///var/secrets/spiffe/agent.sock
Trust domain "production": SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint at https://example.com/auth/spiffe/bundle.json
~~~

Trust bundles in general MUST be keyed by the trust domain identifier to prevent mix-up between trust domains and their corresponding bundles. Bundles obtained from client metadata are additionally keyed by the `client_id`, as described in {{client-scoped-bundles}}.

## Bundles from Client Metadata {#client-scoped-bundles}

When an authorization server obtains a bundle from a client's `spiffe_bundle_endpoint`, it MUST:

* associate the bundle with both the `client_id` and the trust domain of the client's `spiffe_id`, and use it only to validate SVIDs presented to authenticate as that client;
* not add the bundle's keys to any bundle it holds for that trust domain, nor use them to validate SVIDs presented for any other client.

If the authorization server has a bundle for the trust domain obtained as described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}, it SHOULD use that bundle and ignore `spiffe_bundle_endpoint`.

## SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint

The SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint as defined in Section 4 of {{SPIFFE_FEDERATION}} exposes the signing keys for SVIDs over HTTP via a JSON Web Key Set according to {{RFC7517}}.

SPIFFE Federation {{SPIFFE_FEDERATION}} defines two endpoint profiles for serving and consuming a bundle endpoint. For interoperability, the authorization server MUST use the `https_web` profile (Section 5.2.1 of {{SPIFFE_FEDERATION}}). The bundle endpoint is served over HTTPS, and the authorization server verifies the endpoint's server certificate using standard HTTPS server certificate verification against its locally configured trust anchors. This specification does not use the `https_spiffe` profile.

The authorization server SHOULD manage and refresh trust bundles according to Section 4.1 and 4.2 of {{SPIFFE_FEDERATION}}.

The authorization server MUST associate each bundle endpoint with exactly one trust domain, and MUST use keys obtained from that endpoint only to validate SVIDs.

At the time of writing, the SPIFFE bundle endpoint cannot be derived from an SVID or SPIFFE-ID and MUST be configured out of band. The security considerations that apply when configuring it using `spiffe_bundle_endpoint` of Client ID Metadata Documents are described in {{cimd-bundle-security}}.

### Example

The following examples showcase how the Authorization Server can perform key discovery for the trust domain `example.org`. Important to note is the difference between `example.org` trust domain and `example.com` location for the SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint. This highlights the importance of explicit configuration and demonstrates why the SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint cannot be derived or discovered from SVIDs without explicit configuration.

## Alternative methods to avoid

The following key distribution mechanisms are alternatives and SHOULD be avoided for interoperability reasons.

### SPIFFE Workload API

The SPIFFE Workload API allows workloads to retrieve a trust bundle. It requires the authorization server to be part of a SPIFFE trust domain and be considered a workload within it. The SPIFFE Workload API is designed so that the workload receives trust bundle updates as they occur and does not need to poll for them, which reduces the time to distribute them. In addition to the trust bundle of the trust domain the workload resides in, the SPIFFE Workload API also allows retrieval of trust bundles from federated trust domains.

This approach is NOT RECOMMENDED for OAuth SPIFFE Client Authentication for the following reasons:

- OAuth Authorization Server needs to be a workload within a SPIFFE trust domain, which is a significant limitation for deployment scenarios.
- Federated trust domain bundles create ambiguity about how they are handled. When distributed via the SPIFFE Workload API the trust relationship and points where they are established become ambiguous.

### Manual configuration

In small, static environments the authorization server MAY be configured with the SPIFFE bundles manually. This approach requires human interaction to set up, rotate and manage keying material and is thus generally NOT RECOMMENDED.

### Using the system trust store

X509-SVIDs MUST NOT be validated using the system trust store. The SPIFFE ID carried in the URI SAN is usually not a verifiable attribute in the broader X.509 ecosystem. Using the system trust store as trust anchor would allow ANY certificate authority in it to issue a trusted X509-SVID for ANY SPIFFE ID. In comparison: using SPIFFE-native validation methods restricts the signing of SPIFFE-IDs to the corresponding trust domain signing keys.

### Using the JWT-SVID or WIT-SVID `iss` claim {#svid-iss-claim}

JSON Web Token-based credentials carrying `iss` claims could technically be validated by retrieving the signing keys via OpenID Connect Discovery or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata. This approach only applies for the JWT-SVID and WIT-SVID and only works when the `iss` claim is present, which is optional.

Because of its narrow scope and interoperability considerations, this approach is not a general alternative to the SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint. Implementations SHOULD use the mechanisms defined in this specification when available. However, when those mechanisms are not supported by a peer deployment, implementations MAY use `iss`-based discovery and key retrieval for JWT-SVID or WIT-SVID validation as a compatibility mechanism, subject to local policy, appropriate trust configuration and risk mitigations described in {{iss-claim-security-considerations}}.

# Implementation Status

<cref>Note to RFC Editor: please remove this section, as well as the reference to RFC 7942, before publication.</cref>

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in {{!RFC7942}}. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.

According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".

# Security Considerations

Client authentication using JWT-SVIDs has the same security considerations as described in {{RFC6749}}, {{RFC7521}} and {{RFC7523}}.

Client authentication using X509-SVIDs has the same security considerations as described in {{RFC8705}}. The validation rules in {{x509-svid}} protect against an OAuth2 token being issued (or being issued incorrectly) to a client that did not present an appropriate X509-SVID.

Client authentication using WIT-SVIDs has the same security considerations as described in {{I-D.draft-ietf-wimse-workload-creds}} and {{I-D.draft-ietf-oauth-attestation-based-client-auth}}.

The issues described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}} include the risk that an authorization server may have the incorrect trust stores configured to validate the client SVID. This could result in an incorrectly issued token to an attacker if the attacker is able to obtain a certificate that can be validated by one of the misconfigured trust anchors in the trust store.

## Replay of JWT-SVIDs

{{SPIFFE_JWT}} permits but does not require a `jti` claim, and JWT-SVID validators are not required to track `jti` uniqueness. SPIFFE implementations may also return the same cached JWT-SVID to a workload for multiple requests. Authorization servers therefore cannot in general rely on `jti`-based replay detection as described in {{RFC7523}}. An authorization server may use the `jti` claim for replay detection where it is present and the deployment does not reuse JWT-SVIDs across requests. An attacker that obtains a JWT-SVID can use it for client authentication until it expires. The audience restriction in step 3 of {{jwt-svid}} limits its use to this authorization server.

Deployments requiring replay resistance SHOULD either use JWT-SVIDs that carry a unique `jti` claim and are not reused, with the authorization server rejecting a repeated `jti`, or use X509-SVID or WIT-SVID client authentication, which require proof of possession of a private key.

## Trust Bundles from Client ID Metadata Documents {#cimd-bundle-security}

When an authorization server accepts `spiffe_bundle_endpoint` from a Client ID Metadata Document, the party controlling the `client_id` URL also selects the keys used to validate the client's SVIDs. Successful authentication then shows that the client holds a key vouched for by that party, not that the trust domain named in `spiffe_id` issued the SVID. The trust model rests on control of the `client_id` host and the integrity of HTTPS retrieval, as described in the Security Considerations of {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}. In return, trust bundles can be obtained without configuring a bundle endpoint for each trust domain in advance. Deployments that do not accept this trust model MUST ignore `spiffe_bundle_endpoint` values in Client ID Metadata Documents and SHOULD obtain bundles as described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}.

If keys from a document were used beyond the client it describes, an attacker controlling a single document could introduce a signing key of its choice, issue SVIDs for any SPIFFE ID in that trust domain, and authenticate as any other client associated with that trust domain. The rules in {{client-scoped-bundles}} prevent this. They extend the binding between trust domain and bundle described in Section 7.3 of {{SPIFFE_FEDERATION}} to include the `client_id`.

Client scoping does not prevent a document from claiming a trust domain its author does not operate. Trust domain names are chosen by their operators and are not bound to DNS ({{SPIFFE_ID}}), so a document hosted at `https://attacker.example/` can declare a `spiffe_id` of `spiffe://bank.example/payments` together with its own bundle. The attacker can then authenticate only as its own client, but the SPIFFE ID it presents was not issued by the `bank.example` trust domain. Unless the bundle was obtained as described in {{spiffe-bundle-validation}}, or the trust domain is bound to the host of the `client_id` URL, the authorization server MUST NOT treat that SPIFFE ID as issued by the trust domain, for example in authorization policy, access token claims or introspection responses.

Authorization servers that accept bundles from documents SHOULD apply one or more of the following mitigations:

* require the trust domain of `spiffe_id` to equal, or be a subdomain of, the host of the `client_id` URL;
* require `spiffe_id` to be an exact SPIFFE ID rather than a wildcard;
* restrict which `client_id` URLs are accepted using domain allowlists or pre-registration as described in {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}};
* issue short-lived or sender-constrained access tokens to such clients;
* treat a change in `spiffe_id`, `spiffe_bundle_endpoint`, or the keys it serves as a change in client keys, as described in {{I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document}}.

## JWT-SVID and WIT-SVID iss claim {#iss-claim-security-considerations}

As described in {{svid-iss-claim}}, `iss`-based key discovery is not a general alternative to the SPIFFE Bundle Endpoint and SHOULD be avoided.

However, if it is used, the authorization server MUST NOT perform issuer-based discovery solely based on the `iss` value from the token unless the `iss` value is already trusted by the authorization server, and that `iss` value is explicitly associated with the configured SPIFFE Trust Domain being validated.

In addition implementations MUST NOT assume that keys advertised via OpenID Connect Discovery or OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata are dedicated to JWT-SVID issuance. The same provider infrastructure may issue multiple JWT types (e.g., OAuth/OIDC tokens, JWT-SVIDs, WIT-SVIDs). A token MUST NOT be accepted as a JWT-SVID or WIT-SVID solely because it is a JWT, its signature validates under keys discovered from iss, and its `sub` resembles a SPIFFE ID. Doing so can enable token confusion (e.g., presenting an OAuth/OIDC token issued for another purpose as a JWT-SVID). Implementations MUST validate SVIDs according to SVID-specific requirements and MUST use a trust anchor or key source explicitly bound to the configured SPIFFE Trust Domain, rather than generic issuer-based discovery from untrusted token input.
